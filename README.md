## Node.js Fundamentals Repository

Welcome to this repository dedicated to understanding the core principles of Node.js! This repository contains a collection of code snippets and examples illustrating various Node.js concepts and built-in modules.

### Topics Covered:

1. **Basic Operations**

   - `add.js`: An example of a basic arithmetic operation.
   - `buffer.js`: Demonstrations on Node.js buffer operations.

2. **Built-in Modules**

   - `built-in-fs-promises.js`: Working with the File System using promises.
   - `built-in-fs.js`: Basic operations using the File System module.
   - `built-in-http.js`: A basic HTTP server setup.
   - `built-in-events.js`: Demonstrating the Events module.
   - `built-in-path.js`: Path operations using the Path module.

3. **Asynchronous Operations & Event Loop**

   - `event-emitter.js`: Creating and using custom event emitters.
   - `event-loop.js`: Understanding the Node.js event loop.
   - `main-thread.js`: Main thread operations in Node.js.

4. **Modules & Packaging**

   - `math-esm.mjs`: ESM module example.
   - `math.js`: CommonJS module example.
   - `my-custom-package`: A custom package demonstration.
   - `my-cli-package`: Example of a CLI package.
   - `iife.js`: An example of an Immediately Invoked Function Expression in Node.
   - `main.mjs`: Main entry for the ESM module.

5. **Concurrency & Threading**

   - `cluster.js`: Node.js clustering.
   - `no-cluster.js`: Node.js without clustering.
   - `thread-pool.js`: Understanding Node's thread pool.
   - `worker-thread.js`: Working with worker threads in Node.js.

6. **Miscellaneous Topics**

   - `pizza-shop.js`: An imaginary pizza shop example.
   - `streams.js`: Working with Node.js streams.
   - `super-hero.js`, `batman.js`, `superman.js`: Superhero-themed code snippets.

7. **File Examples**
   - `file.txt`, `greet.txt`, `file2.txt.gz`: Sample files for File System operations.

### Usage:

Each file can be executed using the Node.js runtime:

```bash
node <filename>.js
```

If dealing with ESM modules (`.mjs`), ensure that either your Node.js version supports ES modules or that you've set the type to `module` in your `package.json`.
